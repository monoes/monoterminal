<!-- Autonomous research → build → review loop. Researches the project, picks the best improvement, builds it, and reviews until clean. Repeat N times with a leading integer (e.g. `/mastermind:autodev 9`). Use --newfeature N to discover and fully deliver N brand-new features (build → review → document → stage). Supports --tillend. -->

**Pre-PREAMBLE compatibility check:** Before following the REPEAT PREAMBLE, scan `$ARGUMENTS` for both `--newfeature` and `--tillend` present simultaneously. If both are found, emit `[autodev] Warning: --tillend is not supported with --newfeature and will be ignored.` and remove `--tillend` from `$ARGUMENTS` now — before the PREAMBLE processes it — so the PREAMBLE never creates a tillend loop state file.

**First — extract repeat flags:** Follow the REPEAT PREAMBLE from `mastermind-repeat/SKILL.md`. Extracts `--repeat`, `--tillend`, `--maxruns`, `--wait`, `--rep`, `--loop` from `$ARGUMENTS` before all other parsing. If `is_continuation = true`, skip the empty-prompt check and intake below.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:
- **Leading integer** (first token is a bare number, e.g. `9`) → `count = 9` (how many improvements to build)
- `--count <N>` → `count = N`
- `--newfeature <N>` → activate feature mode; `newfeature_count = N`. Discovers N best genuinely-new features and runs full pipeline: Build → Review → Documentation → Delivery for each. Overrides the normal improvement loop.
- `--focus <topic>` → focus hint (e.g. "performance", "security", "dx")
- `--auto` flag → mode = auto
- `--confirm` flag → mode = confirm
- Remaining text → additional focus context

If no count is set, default `count = 1`.
If `--newfeature` is present without a valid N, default `newfeature_count = 3`.
If `newfeature_count > 10`: warn the user and set `newfeature_count = 10`.

Load brain context for the `autodev` domain (follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Load Procedure).

Default mode for this command: **auto** (unless `--confirm` flag present).

Invoke `Skill("mastermind-autodev")` passing: brain_context, count, newfeature_count, focus, mode, board_id (create if needed).

After skill returns: follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Write Procedure for domain `autodev`.

**MANDATORY — invoke `Skill("mastermind-repeat")` now.** This is required regardless of how the skill above completed, regardless of whether you think the work is done, regardless of whether you plan to end your response. For `--repeat N`: the count is non-negotiable — all N runs must happen. For `--tillend`: only a verified empty round (confirmed by git diff) stops the loop. Do not end your response without invoking this skill.
