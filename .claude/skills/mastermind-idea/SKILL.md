# Mastermind Idea Domain

This skill is invoked by `mastermind:master` or directly via `/mastermind:idea`.

**Extract `--monotask` flag:** If present in `$ARGUMENTS`, set `USE_MONOTASK=true` and remove it from `$ARGUMENTS`. Default: `USE_MONOTASK=false`.

**File mode (default, `USE_MONOTASK=false`):**

Invoke `Skill("mastermind-ideate", $ARGUMENTS)` immediately — it provides the same research, evaluation, elaboration, and task-decomposition pipeline with file-first storage (`docs/ideas/` and `docs/tasks/`). The rest of this skill is skipped in file mode.

**Board mode (`USE_MONOTASK=true`):**

Continue with the full monotask board pipeline below (Steps 3-6).

---

## Inputs

- `brain_context`: BRAIN CONTEXT block (injected by master, or loaded standalone via mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md brain load)
- `prompt`: the ideation goal for this run
- `project_name`: monotask space name
- `mode`: auto | confirm

Note: the `board_id` that mastermind:master may pass is its own orchestration board. The idea domain always creates a dedicated **ideation board** with its own pipeline columns — do not reuse master's board_id.

---

## Complexity Assessment

Assess the prompt to determine execution mode:

**Simple (direct execution):** Single-answer ideation, one agent:
- "Give me 5 name ideas for this feature"
- "Suggest one pivot angle for this product"
→ Use a single researcher or content-creator agent. Skip Steps 3–6. Go straight to Step 7 (Brain Write).

**Complex (full pipeline):** Any of these:
- Product strategy or pivot exploration (multiple angles needed)
- Feature ideation requiring market and user context
- Competitive landscape brainstorm
- Full product vision document
→ Run Steps 3–6 (Board Setup → Idea Manager → Validation → Elaboration + Tasks).

---

## Standalone Execution (when called without master)

If this skill is invoked directly (not by master):

1. Load brain context following mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Load Procedure (namespace: `idea`)
2. Run intake from mastermind-intake/SKILL.md if prompt is vague
3. For complex prompts: run Steps 3–6 below
4. At end: follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Write Procedure (namespace: `idea`)

---

## Simple Execution

For simple prompts (single agent, single output):

1. Spawn one Task agent with the ideation request as a self-contained briefing
2. Collect output
3. If called standalone (not from master): follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Write Procedure (namespace: `idea`)
4. Return unified output schema with `status: complete`

---

## Complex Execution

### Step 3 — Monotask Board Setup

Set up the space and ideation board. The ideation board has a dedicated pipeline with six columns (not master's board).

```bash
# Compatible with macOS bash 3.2
project_name="${project_name:-$(basename "$PWD")}"
date=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
idea_canonical="${project_name}-idea"

# Find or create space (by exact name)
space_id=$(monotask space list 2>/dev/null | awk -F'|' '{gsub(/^ +| +$/,"",$1);gsub(/^ +| +$/,"",$2);if($2==n)print $1}' n="$project_name" | head -1)
[ -z "$space_id" ] && space_id=$(monotask space create "$project_name" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}')
[ -z "$space_id" ] && { echo "ERROR: Could not find or create space '$project_name'"; exit 1; }

# Find existing idea board by canonical name — reuse across runs (same pattern as master Step 6)
# board list format is "uuid: name" (colon-space separator, NOT pipe)
BOARD_ID=$(monotask board list 2>/dev/null | awk -F': ' '{gsub(/^ +| +$/,"",$1);gsub(/^ +| +$/,"",$2);if($2==n)print $1}' n="$idea_canonical" | head -1)

if [ -n "$BOARD_ID" ]; then
  echo "Reusing idea board: $BOARD_ID ($idea_canonical)"
  columns=$(monotask column list "$BOARD_ID" --json)
  COL_NEW=$(echo "$columns"       | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "New")        | .id' | head -1)
  COL_EVALUATED=$(echo "$columns" | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Evaluated")  | .id' | head -1)
  COL_ELABORATED=$(echo "$columns"| jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Elaborated") | .id' | head -1)
  COL_TASKED=$(echo "$columns"    | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Tasked")     | .id' | head -1)
  COL_ICED=$(echo "$columns"      | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Iced")       | .id' | head -1)
  COL_REJECTED=$(echo "$columns"  | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Rejected")   | .id' | head -1)
  [ -z "$COL_NEW" ]        && { echo "ERROR: 'New' column missing on board $BOARD_ID — was board created with wrong schema?"; exit 1; }
  [ -z "$COL_EVALUATED" ]  && { echo "ERROR: 'Evaluated' column missing on board $BOARD_ID"; exit 1; }
  [ -z "$COL_ELABORATED" ] && { echo "ERROR: 'Elaborated' column missing on board $BOARD_ID"; exit 1; }
  [ -z "$COL_TASKED" ]     && { echo "ERROR: 'Tasked' column missing on board $BOARD_ID"; exit 1; }
  [ -z "$COL_ICED" ]       && { echo "ERROR: 'Iced' column missing on board $BOARD_ID"; exit 1; }
  [ -z "$COL_REJECTED" ]   && { echo "ERROR: 'Rejected' column missing on board $BOARD_ID"; exit 1; }
else
  echo "Creating idea board: $idea_canonical"
  BOARD_ID=$(monotask board create --space "$space_id" "$idea_canonical" --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.id // empty')
  [ -z "$BOARD_ID" ] && { echo "ERROR: Failed to create idea board '$idea_canonical'"; exit 1; }
  monotask space boards add "$space_id" "$BOARD_ID" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  COL_NEW=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID"       "New"        --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  COL_EVALUATED=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID" "Evaluated"  --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  COL_ELABORATED=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID" "Elaborated" --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  COL_TASKED=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID"    "Tasked"     --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  COL_ICED=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID"      "Iced"       --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  COL_REJECTED=$(monotask column create "$BOARD_ID"  "Rejected"   --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
fi
```

**After either branch above, validate and echo all values.** This is the canonical source for Step 4 Task construction.

```bash
# Guard all column IDs — catches silent jq failures in the create branch
[ -z "$COL_NEW" ]        && { echo "ERROR: COL_NEW empty after board setup"; exit 1; }
[ -z "$COL_EVALUATED" ]  && { echo "ERROR: COL_EVALUATED empty after board setup"; exit 1; }
[ -z "$COL_ELABORATED" ] && { echo "ERROR: COL_ELABORATED empty after board setup"; exit 1; }
[ -z "$COL_TASKED" ]     && { echo "ERROR: COL_TASKED empty after board setup"; exit 1; }
[ -z "$COL_ICED" ]       && { echo "ERROR: COL_ICED empty after board setup"; exit 1; }
[ -z "$COL_REJECTED" ]   && { echo "ERROR: COL_REJECTED empty after board setup"; exit 1; }

# Validate BOARD_ID looks like a UUID before proceeding
[[ ! "$BOARD_ID" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$ ]] && \
  { echo "ERROR: BOARD_ID '$BOARD_ID' is not a valid UUID — aborting to prevent board name corruption"; exit 1; }

# Echo literal values — READ THESE and embed them as string literals in the Step 4 Task prompt.
# These are shell variables; they DO NOT survive into the Task agent's context.
echo "=== IDEA BOARD LITERAL VALUES ==="
echo "BOARD_ID=$BOARD_ID"
echo "COL_NEW=$COL_NEW"
echo "COL_EVALUATED=$COL_EVALUATED"
echo "COL_ELABORATED=$COL_ELABORATED"
echo "COL_TASKED=$COL_TASKED"
echo "COL_ICED=$COL_ICED"
echo "COL_REJECTED=$COL_REJECTED"
echo "==================================="
```

---

### Step 4 — Idea Manager Agent (Divergent Thinking)

**Before spawning the Idea Manager**, run the registry-aware specialist selection to determine which agents to use. This replaces hardcoded agent types with the best available specialists for the prompt.

```bash
REGISTRY=".monomind/registry.json"
PROMPT="$prompt"
TOP_N=6

# Select user/market/ops angle specialists
CATEGORIES="marketing strategy product academic specialized"
user_market_agents=$(jq \
  --arg cats "$CATEGORIES" \
  --arg kw "$(echo "$PROMPT" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | grep -oE '[a-z]{5,}' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' ')" \
  --argjson n "$TOP_N" \
  '[ (.agents // [])[] | select(.deprecated != true)
     | select(.category as $c | ($cats | split(" ") | any(. == $c)))
     | {name: .name, slug: .slug, category: .category,
        score: (
          (.name | ascii_downcase) as $n |
          # Score on ANY keyword match (mirrors master.md pick_domain_manager scoring)
          (if ($kw | length) > 0
           then ([$kw | split(" ")[] | select(length > 0) | if ($n | contains(.)) then 1 else 0 end] | add // 0)
           else 0 end)
        )}
   ] | sort_by(-.score) | unique_by(.slug) | .[0:$n] | [.[].name]' \
  "$REGISTRY" 2>/dev/null)

# Select technical angle specialists
CATEGORIES="engineering development architecture"
tech_agents=$(jq \
  --arg cats "$CATEGORIES" \
  --argjson n 3 \
  '[ (.agents // [])[] | select(.deprecated != true)
     | select(.category as $c | ($cats | split(" ") | any(. == $c)))
     | {name: .name, slug: .slug}
   ] | unique_by(.slug) | .[0:$n] | [.[].name]' \
  "$REGISTRY" 2>/dev/null)

# Merge: take top 6 from market/ops + top 2 from tech (cap at 8 total)
# Both variables hold JSON arrays (no -r flag) — use jq -s add to merge properly
specialist_list=$(jq -s 'add // [] | unique | .[0:8]' \
  <(printf '%s' "$user_market_agents") \
  <(printf '%s' "$tech_agents") 2>/dev/null)

# Fallback if registry missing or returned an empty array — need at least 2 specialists
specialist_count=$(echo "$specialist_list" | jq 'length // 0' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[ "$specialist_count" -lt 2 ] && specialist_list='["researcher","Trend Researcher","Growth Hacker","UX Researcher","Content Creator","Account Strategist"]'

echo "Selected specialists: $specialist_list"
```

**CRITICAL — Variable substitution required before constructing the Task call:**
The Task agent runs in an isolated context and cannot inherit shell variables. Before writing the Task prompt below, read the literal UUID values from the `=== IDEA BOARD LITERAL VALUES ===` echo block above and embed them as **hard-coded strings** in the prompt. Do NOT write `${BOARD_ID}`, `${COL_NEW}`, etc. in the prompt — the agent will receive those as literal dollar-sign strings and its `monotask card create` calls will fail, causing it to improvise with `monotask board create` and corrupt board names. Replace every `${BOARD_ID}`, `${COL_NEW}`, `${project_name}`, `${brain_context}`, `${prompt}`, `${date}`, and `${specialist_list}` with the actual value before calling Task. Leave `$result`, `$CARD_ID`, and other loop-internal variables as-is — they are bash variables the agent itself will set at runtime, not substitution targets.

Spawn the Idea Manager with `run_in_background: false` so its output is available for Step 5.

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "coordinator",
  description: "Idea Manager for project " + project_name,
  run_in_background: false,
  prompt: `SAFETY CHECK: Before doing anything else, verify that the BOARD_ID you received matches UUID format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (8-4-4-4-12 hex chars). If it does not, STOP immediately and report "ERROR: BOARD_ID was not substituted — received: <value>". Do NOT call monotask board create, monotask space create, or any board/space/column creation commands. Your only job is creating CARDS on the board you were given.

You are the Idea Manager for project "${project_name}".

CONTEXT: ${date} | Project: ${project_name} | Spawned by: mastermind:idea

BRAIN CONTEXT:
${brain_context}

YOUR BOARD: ${BOARD_ID}
COL_NEW: ${COL_NEW}
YOUR GOAL: ${prompt}

STEP 1 — PLAN
Decompose the ideation goal into distinct exploration angles. For each angle, identify:
- Perspective (market, user, technical, competitive, business operations)
- Which specialist to assign
- Expected output format

STEP 2 — SPAWN SPECIALISTS
Spawn one Task agent per angle (all in parallel, mesh topology). Each agent receives the
angle description, brain context, and project context, and must return a JSON array of ideas.

The following specialist agents have been pre-selected from the registry as best-fit for this prompt.
Spawn ALL of them in one message, assigning each a distinct angle:

SPECIALISTS: ${specialist_list}

Assign each specialist the angle that best matches their domain expertise.
For any specialist you don't recognize, assign them the closest research or analysis angle.
Always ensure at minimum these angles are covered even if the same agent covers multiple:
- Market / competitive landscape
- User / UX perspective
- Growth / acquisition
- Business operations / process
- Technical feasibility (at least one engineering-category agent)

Each specialist must classify every idea with one of these categories:
  feature             — new product capability for end users
  technical-baseline  — infrastructure, tooling, or technical debt (not user-visible)
  business-operation  — internal process, workflow, marketing, sales, ops, or org change

Each specialist returns ideas in this format:
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "category": "feature | technical-baseline | business-operation"
  }
]

STEP 3 — DEDUPLICATE
Collect all ideas from all specialists. Drop any idea whose title is more than 80% similar
to an already-kept idea (fuzzy match). Keep the richer description when deduplicating.

STEP 4 — CREATE CARDS AND RETURN
For each unique idea, create one card in the New column (COL_NEW = ${COL_NEW}):

  result=$(monotask card create "${BOARD_ID}" "${COL_NEW}" "<idea title ≤80 chars>" --json)
  CARD_ID=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.id // empty')
  [ -z "$CARD_ID" ] && { echo "WARN: card creation failed for '<idea title>', skipping"; continue; }
  monotask card set-description "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "<2-3 sentence description>"
  monotask card comment add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "CATEGORY: <feature | technical-baseline | business-operation>
SOURCE: <which specialist angle produced this>"
  monotask card label add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "mastermind-idea"
  monotask card label add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "category:<category>"

Then output a JSON block labelled IDEAS_OUTPUT with one entry per unique idea:

IDEAS_OUTPUT
[
  {
    "card_id": "<monotask card ID just created>",
    "title": "<idea title>",
    "description": "<2-3 sentence description>",
    "category": "feature | technical-baseline | business-operation",
    "source_angle": "<which specialist produced this>"
  }
]
END_IDEAS_OUTPUT`
})
```

Parse the `IDEAS_OUTPUT` JSON block from the agent's response and assign it:
```bash
ideas_output_json='<paste the JSON array from IDEAS_OUTPUT here>'
```
If the `IDEAS_OUTPUT` block is absent from the agent's response (agent error, timeout, or unrecoverable failure), set `ideas_output_json='[]'` and treat as zero ideas.
If zero ideas were returned, report "Idea Manager produced no ideas." — skip Steps 5–6 and proceed to Step 7 (Brain Write).

---

### Step 5 — Validation (Product Manager Evaluation)

**Build `ideas_list` before constructing the Step 5 Task prompt:**
```bash
# Format the full IDEAS_OUTPUT array (from Step 4) as the literal string to embed in the Task prompt.
# Each line: card_id | title | description | category | source_angle
ideas_list=$(echo "$ideas_output_json" | jq -r \
  '.[] | "- card_id: \(.card_id)\n  title: \(.title)\n  description: \(.description)\n  category: \(.category)\n  source: \(.source_angle)\n"')
```

**CRITICAL — Variable substitution required for Step 5 Task call:**
Before constructing the Task prompt below, read the literal UUID values from the `=== IDEA BOARD LITERAL VALUES ===` echo block (Step 3) and embed them as hard-coded strings. Also embed the full `brain_context`, `prompt`, and `ideas_list` (built above) as literal text. Replace every `${BOARD_ID}`, `${COL_EVALUATED}`, `${COL_ICED}`, `${COL_REJECTED}`, `${brain_context}`, `${prompt}`, `${project_name}`, `${date}`, and `${ideas_list}` with its actual value before calling Task — the agent receives unsubstituted `${...}` strings verbatim and silently skips every board update.

Spawn a single `general-purpose` agent via the Task tool. Do NOT use `Product Manager` — that agent type lacks Bash tool access and cannot execute `monotask` CLI commands. The evaluator agent produces verdicts and executes all board updates directly via Bash.

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "PM validation for project " + project_name,
  run_in_background: false,
  prompt: `SAFETY CHECK: Verify that the BOARD_ID you received matches UUID format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (8-4-4-4-12 hex chars). If it does not, STOP and report "ERROR: BOARD_ID not substituted — received: <value>". Do NOT call monotask board create, space create, or column create. Your only job is evaluating cards and running impact/effort updates on existing cards.

You are the Product Manager evaluator for project "${project_name}".

CONTEXT: ${date} | Project: ${project_name}
ORIGINAL GOAL: ${prompt}

BRAIN CONTEXT:
${brain_context}

YOUR BOARD: ${BOARD_ID}
COL_EVALUATED: ${COL_EVALUATED}
COL_ICED:      ${COL_ICED}
COL_REJECTED:  ${COL_REJECTED}

IDEAS TO EVALUATE (formatted from IDEAS_OUTPUT parsed in Step 4 — paste the full JSON array here as literal text):
${ideas_list}

For EVERY idea above, determine:
- verdict: evaluated | iced | rejected
- impact: 0–10 (business value / strategic importance)
- effort: 0–10 (implementation cost / complexity)
- skipElaboration: true (simple, no deep research needed) | false (edge cases should be explored) — only for evaluated
- rationale: 1-2 sentence value statement (evaluated), blocking question (iced), or rejection reason (rejected)

MANDATORY BOARD UPDATES — after determining all verdicts, build your verdicts as a JSON array and iterate over it:

  # Paste your full VERDICTS_OUTPUT array here as verdicts_json (before outputting the block)
  verdicts_json='[ ... your verdict objects ... ]'
  while IFS= read -r row; do
    CARD_ID=$(echo "$row" | jq -r '.card_id')
    verdict=$(echo "$row"   | jq -r '.verdict')
    impact=$(echo "$row"    | jq -r '.impact')
    effort=$(echo "$row"    | jq -r '.effort')
    rationale=$(echo "$row" | jq -r '.rationale')
    if [ "$verdict" = "evaluated" ]; then
      monotask card move "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "${COL_EVALUATED}" --json
      monotask card set-impact "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "$impact"
      monotask card set-effort "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "$effort"
      monotask card comment add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "Value: $rationale"
    elif [ "$verdict" = "iced" ]; then
      monotask card move "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "${COL_ICED}" --json
      monotask card set-impact "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "$impact"
      monotask card set-effort "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "$effort"
      monotask card comment add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "Blocked: $rationale"
    elif [ "$verdict" = "rejected" ]; then
      monotask card move "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "${COL_REJECTED}" --json
      monotask card comment add "${BOARD_ID}" "$CARD_ID" "Rejected: $rationale"
    fi
  done < <(echo "$verdicts_json" | jq -c '.[]')

IMPORTANT: set-impact and set-effort MUST be called for every evaluated and iced idea. Do not skip them.

After completing all board updates, output this structured block:

VERDICTS_OUTPUT
[
  {
    "card_id": "<card ID>",
    "title": "<idea title>",
    "category": "feature | technical-baseline | business-operation",
    "verdict": "evaluated | iced | rejected",
    "skipElaboration": true | false,
    "rationale": "<value statement | blocking question | rejection reason>",
    "impact": <0-10>,
    "effort": <0-10>
  }
]
END_VERDICTS_OUTPUT`
})
```

After the PM agent completes, parse the `VERDICTS_OUTPUT` block from the agent's response and assign it:
```bash
verdicts_output_json='<paste the JSON array from VERDICTS_OUTPUT here>'
```
If the `VERDICTS_OUTPUT` block is absent (agent error or malformed output), set `verdicts_output_json='[]'` — all ideas will be treated as iced and Step 6 will be skipped.
This variable is used throughout Steps 6a and 6c to build idea lists, registry keywords, and inherit impact/effort scores — it must be set before proceeding. If **all** ideas are iced or rejected, output a summary table — skip Step 6 and proceed to Step 7 (Brain Write).

---

### Step 6 — Elaboration + Task Decomposition

#### 6a. Elaboration (conditional)

For any evaluated idea with `skipElaboration: true`, move it directly to `Elaborated`, set a description, and write a rationale comment so future readers understand why no deep elaboration was needed:
```bash
while IFS= read -r skip_idea; do
  CARD_ID=$(echo "$skip_idea"  | jq -r '.card_id')
  skip_title=$(echo "$skip_idea"   | jq -r '.title')
  skip_rationale=$(echo "$skip_idea" | jq -r '.rationale // "No rationale provided"')
  skip_impact=$(echo "$skip_idea"  | jq -r '.impact // 5')
  skip_effort=$(echo "$skip_idea"  | jq -r '.effort // 5')
  monotask card set-description "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "Elaboration skipped — PM assessed this as straightforward.

Rationale: $skip_rationale

Impact: $skip_impact/10 | Effort: $skip_effort/10"
  monotask card move "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "$COL_ELABORATED" --json
  monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "Elaboration skipped: PM assessed this idea as straightforward with no significant unknowns. Rationale: $skip_rationale"
done < <(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -c '[.[] | select(.verdict == "evaluated") | select(.skipElaboration == true)] | .[]')
```

For ideas with `skipElaboration: false`, **split by category** before spawning agents:

**Build `dev_ideas_list` and `ops_ideas_list` before constructing the Step 6a Task prompts:**
```bash
# Filter VERDICTS_OUTPUT (parsed in Step 5) by category and format as literal text.
# IMPORTANT: exclude skipElaboration:true ideas — they were already moved to Elaborated above
# and must not be sent to elaboration agents again.
dev_ideas_list=$(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -r \
  '.[] | select(.verdict == "evaluated") | select(.skipElaboration != true)
       | select(.category == "feature" or .category == "technical-baseline") |
   "- card_id: \(.card_id)\n  title: \(.title)\n  category: \(.category)\n  rationale: \(.rationale)\n"')

ops_ideas_list=$(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -r \
  '.[] | select(.verdict == "evaluated") | select(.skipElaboration != true)
       | select(.category == "business-operation") |
   "- card_id: \(.card_id)\n  title: \(.title)\n  category: \(.category)\n  rationale: \(.rationale)\n"')
```

**CRITICAL — Variable substitution required for Step 6a Task calls:**
Elaboration agents run in isolated Task contexts. Before constructing each Task prompt, replace every `${brain_context}`, `${dev_ideas_list}`, and `${ops_ideas_list}` with the actual literal text — `brain_context` from the brain load, `dev_ideas_list` and `ops_ideas_list` built above. Do NOT leave any `${...}` placeholders in the prompt — the agent receives them as literal dollar-sign strings and produces empty ELABORATION_OUTPUT blocks.

**Dev ideas** (`feature` or `technical-baseline`) — **skip if `dev_ideas_list` is empty** (no evaluated feature/technical-baseline ideas without skipElaboration; set `dev_researcher_json='[]'` and `dev_codebase_json='[]'` instead and do not spawn these agents):
Spawn two agents in parallel via Task tool:

```javascript
// Agent 1 — code explorer
Task({
  subagent_type: "feature-dev:code-explorer",
  description: "Elaboration: codebase constraints for dev ideas",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `SAFETY CHECK: You are an elaboration agent. Do NOT call monotask board create, space create, or column create. Your only job is producing an ELABORATION_OUTPUT block — the outer skill writes to the board.

Analyze the following dev ideas against the current codebase. For each idea, trace relevant execution paths, map dependencies, and surface constraints or implementation risks.

BRAIN CONTEXT:
${brain_context}

IDEAS:
${dev_ideas_list}

Output this block:
ELABORATION_OUTPUT
[
  {
    "card_id": "<idea card ID>",
    "findings": "<detailed codebase constraints, dependency risks, and implementation notes>",
    "blocking_issue": "<blocking issue if any, or null>"
  }
]
END_ELABORATION_OUTPUT`
})

// Agent 2 — researcher
Task({
  subagent_type: "researcher",
  description: "Elaboration: prior art and edge cases for dev ideas",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `SAFETY CHECK: You are an elaboration agent. Do NOT call monotask board create, space create, or column create. Your only job is producing an ELABORATION_OUTPUT block — the outer skill writes to the board.

Research the following dev ideas. For each idea, find prior art, known edge cases, implementation pitfalls, and relevant open-source approaches.

BRAIN CONTEXT:
${brain_context}

IDEAS:
${dev_ideas_list}

Output this block:
ELABORATION_OUTPUT
[
  {
    "card_id": "<idea card ID>",
    "findings": "<prior art, edge cases, pitfalls, and relevant examples>",
    "blocking_issue": "<blocking issue if any, or null>"
  }
]
END_ELABORATION_OUTPUT`
})
```

**Business-operation ideas** (`business-operation`) — **skip if `ops_ideas_list` is empty** (no evaluated business-operation ideas without skipElaboration; set `ops_researcher_json='[]'` and `ops_pm_json='[]'` instead and do not spawn these agents):
Spawn two agents in parallel via Task tool:

```javascript

Wait for all spawned background elaboration agents to complete before proceeding (0, 2, or 4 agents depending on which lists were non-empty — see guards above). Then build `merged_elaboration_json` by merging agent outputs per `card_id` and injecting `category` from `verdicts_output_json`:

```bash
# Assign each agent's ELABORATION_OUTPUT JSON array from its output block:
dev_researcher_json='<ELABORATION_OUTPUT array from the dev researcher agent>'

ops_researcher_json='<ELABORATION_OUTPUT array from the ops researcher agent>'
ops_pm_json='<ELABORATION_OUTPUT array from the ops PM agent>'
# Use '[]' for any track that had no ideas (e.g. if all ideas were dev, set ops_* to '[]')
# If an ELABORATION_OUTPUT block is absent from an agent's response (error/timeout), set that variable to '[]'

# Merge dev track: full outer join researcher + codebase by card_id, inject category from verdicts.
# Use union of card_ids from both agents — if one agent skips a card the other covers, it's preserved.
# blocking_issue: take from whichever agent found one (researcher OR codebase).
dev_merged=$(jq -n \

#### 6b. User Confirmation Gate

**Auto-mode bypass:** If `mode` is `auto` (set by mastermind:master or caller), skip this gate entirely and proceed directly to Step 6c with all elaborated ideas.

**Confirm mode only:** If `mode` is `confirm` (default), present a review table of all elaborated ideas to the user.

Build the table from `verdicts_output_json` (filtered to `verdict == "evaluated"` AND `card_id` not in the set of ideas with a non-null `blocking_issue` in `merged_elaboration_json`). Exclude ideas iced during elaboration — they are already in the `Iced` column and must not appear in this review. For each row:
- **Impact** and **Effort** come from `.impact` and `.effort` fields in `verdicts_output_json`
- **Track**: `feature` or `technical-baseline` → `dev`; `business-operation` → `ops`

Print this exact format:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  IDEA REVIEW — Please confirm before task generation                ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

#  | Title                          | Category          | Impact | Effort | Track
---|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|-------
1  | <title>                        | <category>        | <N>/10 | <N>/10 | dev / ops
2  | <title>                        | <category>        | <N>/10 | <N>/10 | dev / ops
...

To proceed: reply with one of:
  • "go" — generate tasks for all ideas above
  • "remove 2,4" — drop ideas by number, generate tasks for the rest
  • "remove 3 | add detail to 1: <your notes>" — remove some, annotate others
  • "add detail to 2: <your notes>" — annotate an idea before decomposing
  • "stop" — cancel task generation

Waiting for your confirmation.
```

Wait for the user's response before continuing. Do not spawn any agents until a reply is received.

**Process the user's reply:**

- **"go"**: proceed with all elaborated ideas.
- **"remove N[,N...]"**: remove those ideas from the elaboration list. Move their ideation cards to `Iced`:
  ```bash
  monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "Removed by user before task generation"
  monotask card move "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "$COL_ICED" --json
  ```
- **"add detail to N: <notes>"**: append the notes as a card comment before decomposing:
  ```bash
  monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "User notes: <notes>"
  ```
- **"stop"**: skip Step 6c. Proceed directly to Step 7 (Brain Write). Print a summary of ideas in Elaborated/Iced/Rejected and return `status: partial`.
- Combined instructions ("remove 2,4 | add detail to 1: ...") are processed together.

After applying all user instructions, proceed to Step 6c with the remaining ideas.

#### 6c. Task Decomposition

**Select decomposition agents from the registry** before spawning. Run this selection once per track:

```bash
REGISTRY=".monomind/registry.json"

# Dev decomposition agent — pick the most relevant engineering/architecture specialist
dev_decomp_agent=$(jq -r \
  '[ (.agents // [])[] | select(.deprecated != true)
     | select(.category == "engineering" or .category == "architecture")
     | {name: .name,
        score: (.name | ascii_downcase |
                if contains("architect") then 3
                elif contains("backend") then 2
                elif contains("mobile") then 2
                elif contains("frontend") then 2
                elif contains("security") then 2
                elif contains("data") then 2
                else 1 end
               )}
   ] | sort_by(-.score) | .[0].name // "Software Architect"' \
  "$REGISTRY" 2>/dev/null)
dev_decomp_agent="${dev_decomp_agent:-Software Architect}"

# Ops decomposition agent — pick the most relevant strategy/sales/product specialist
ops_decomp_agent=$(jq -r \
  '[ (.agents // [])[] | select(.deprecated != true)
     | select(.category == "strategy" or .category == "sales" or .category == "product" or .category == "marketing")
     | {name: .name,
        score: (.name | ascii_downcase |
                if contains("product manager") then 4
                elif contains("launch") then 3
                elif contains("outbound") then 3
                elif contains("deal") then 3
                elif contains("pricing") then 3
                elif contains("growth") then 2
                else 1 end
               )}
   ] | sort_by(-.score) | .[0].name // "Product Manager"' \
  "$REGISTRY" 2>/dev/null)
ops_decomp_agent="${ops_decomp_agent:-Product Manager}"

echo "Dev decomp: $dev_decomp_agent | Ops decomp: $ops_decomp_agent"
```

**CRITICAL — Variable substitution required for Step 6c Task calls:**
Before constructing each Task prompt, replace `${brain_context}`, `${prompt}`, `${project_name}`, `${dev_ideas_elaborated}`, and `${ops_ideas_elaborated}` with actual literal text. Also substitute the `subagent_type` values: replace `dev_decomp_agent` and `ops_decomp_agent` with the string values echoed by the registry selection above (e.g. `"Software Architect"`). Build those lists from the VERDICTS_OUTPUT and ELABORATION_OUTPUT results:

```bash
# Collect IDs of cards iced during elaboration (blocking_issue was set) — exclude from decomposition.
# merged_elaboration_json covers agent-elaborated ideas only (not skipElaboration:true ones).
elaboration_blocked=$(echo "$merged_elaboration_json" | jq \
  '[.[] | select(.blocking_issue != null and .blocking_issue != "" and .blocking_issue != "null") | .card_id]')
# Safeguard: if jq failed (e.g. null input), default to empty array so decomp proceeds safely
[ -z "$elaboration_blocked" ] && elaboration_blocked='[]'

# Build elaborated idea lists for decomposition agents.
# Include: evaluated ideas (PM verdict) that were NOT iced during elaboration.
# This covers both skipElaboration:true ideas and agent-elaborated ideas in the Elaborated column.
# Use `any(. == $id)` not `contains([$id])` — contains does substring matching on strings (wrong for UUIDs).
dev_ideas_elaborated=$(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -r \
  --argjson blocked "$elaboration_blocked" \
  '[.[] | select(.verdict=="evaluated")
         | select(.card_id as $id | ($blocked | any(. == $id)) | not)
         | select(.category=="feature" or .category=="technical-baseline") |
   "card_id: \(.card_id)\ntitle: \(.title)\ncategory: \(.category)\nrationale: \(.rationale)\nimpact: \(.impact) effort: \(.effort)"] | join("\n\n")')

ops_ideas_elaborated=$(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -r \
  --argjson blocked "$elaboration_blocked" \
  '[.[] | select(.verdict=="evaluated")
         | select(.card_id as $id | ($blocked | any(. == $id)) | not)
         | select(.category=="business-operation") |
   "card_id: \(.card_id)\ntitle: \(.title)\ncategory: \(.category)\nrationale: \(.rationale)\nimpact: \(.impact) effort: \(.effort)"] | join("\n\n")')
```

**Spawn decomposition agents by track** — run both in parallel if both tracks have elaborated ideas:

```javascript
// Dev decomposition agent (only if dev_ideas_elaborated is non-empty)

  subagent_type: dev_decomp_agent,  // value from registry selection above

BRAIN CONTEXT:
${brain_context}

})
```

**After both decomposition agents return**, the outer skill creates task cards on the appropriate board for each task's category. Each task card inherits the parent idea's `impact` and `effort` scores from the VERDICTS_OUTPUT parsed in Step 5 — look up by `parent_card_id`.

  TASK_CARD_ID=$(monotask card subtask add "$BOARD_ID" "$parent_card_id" "$TARGET_BOARD" "$COL_TARGET" "$title" --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
  [ -z "$TASK_CARD_ID" ] && { echo "WARN: subtask creation failed for '$title' (parent: $parent_card_id), skipping"; continue; }
  # Set the task description as the primary content field
  monotask card set-description "$TARGET_BOARD" "$TASK_CARD_ID" "$description"
  monotask card set-impact "$TARGET_BOARD" "$TASK_CARD_ID" "$parent_impact"
  monotask card set-effort "$TARGET_BOARD" "$TASK_CARD_ID" "$parent_effort"
  # Derive parent idea title for the comment
  parent_idea_title=$(echo "$verdicts_output_json" | jq -r --arg id "$parent_card_id" '.[] | select(.card_id == $id) | .title // "unknown"')

After the loop, annotate each parent idea card and move it to `Tasked`:
```bash
for summary_file in "$SUBTASK_TMPDIR"/*; do
  [ -f "$summary_file" ] || continue
  parent_card_id=$(basename "$summary_file")
  subtask_list=$(cat "$summary_file")
  monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$parent_card_id" \
    "Subtasks created:
${subtask_list}"
  monotask card move "$BOARD_ID" "$parent_card_id" "$COL_TASKED" --json
done
rm -rf "$SUBTASK_TMPDIR"
```

For each entry in FLAGGED, parse the flagged JSON from both decomp agents' FLAGGED blocks and iterate:
```bash
# Collect flagged entries from both decomp agents
dev_flagged_json='<FLAGGED array from dev decomp agent, or [] if none>'
ops_flagged_json='<FLAGGED array from ops decomp agent, or [] if none>'
# If FLAGGED block is absent from an agent's response, set that variable to '[]'
merged_flagged_json=$(jq -s 'add // []' <(echo "$dev_flagged_json") <(echo "$ops_flagged_json"))

while IFS= read -r flagged; do
  flagged_card_id=$(echo "$flagged" | jq -r '.card_id')
  flagged_question=$(echo "$flagged" | jq -r '.question // "Needs clarification before decomposition"')
  monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$flagged_card_id" "Needs clarification: $flagged_question"
  monotask card move "$BOARD_ID" "$flagged_card_id" "$COL_ICED" --json
done < <(echo "$merged_flagged_json" | jq -c '.[]')
```

### Step 7 — Brain Write + Return

Follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Write Procedure (namespace: `idea`).

**Write domain output to session file** so master Step 9 aggregation can include this domain. Skip silently if running standalone (no SESSION_ID in current.json):

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
_get_mono_dir() {
  local w="${1:-$(pwd)}"
  if [ -d "$w/.git" ]; then echo "$w/.git/monomind"; return; fi
  if [ -f "$w/.git" ]; then
    local m; m=$(grep '^gitdir:' "$w/.git" | sed 's/gitdir: *//')
    [ -z "$m" ] && { echo "$w/.monomind"; return; }
    [[ "$m" != /* ]] && m="$w/$m"
    echo "$(dirname "$(dirname "$m")")/monomind"; return
  fi
  echo "$w/.monomind"
}
MONO_DIR=$(_get_mono_dir "$REPO_ROOT")
SESSION_ID=$(jq -r '.sessionId // empty' "$MONO_DIR/sessions/current.json" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$SESSION_ID" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$MONO_DIR/sessions/${SESSION_ID}"
  CTRL_URL=$(jq -r '.url // "http://localhost:4242"' "$REPO_ROOT/.monomind/control.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "http://localhost:4242")
  # LLM: substitute <status>: complete (all steps ran), partial (some skipped), blocked (critical error)
  # LLM: substitute next_actions with actual suggestions derived from this run's top ideas
  jq -n \
    --arg domain "idea" \
    --arg status "<status>" \
    --argjson artifacts '[]' \
    --argjson next_actions '["<next_action_1>","<next_action_2>"]' \
    '{domain:$domain,status:$status,artifacts:$artifacts,next_actions:$next_actions}' \
    > "$MONO_DIR/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/idea.json"
  curl -s -o /dev/null -X POST "${CTRL_URL}/api/mastermind/event" -H "x-monomind-token: $(cat "${REPO_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}/.monomind/dashboard-token" 2>/dev/null || true)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(jq -cn --arg sid "$SESSION_ID" --arg status "<status>" \
      '{type:"domain:complete",session:$sid,domain:"idea",status:$status,ts:(now*1000|floor)}')" || true
fi
```

Return unified output schema to caller:
