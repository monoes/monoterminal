# Agent Delegation Capability

This file defines the **AGENT DELEGATION CAPABILITY** block that MUST be included verbatim in every `Task` / `Agent` spawn within mastermind and monomind commands.

Including it in every agent prompt makes delegation **recursive**: an agent can spawn sub-agents, which can spawn their own sub-agents, each with full access to the same capability.

---

## How to use this file

When writing a Task/Agent `description` or `prompt`, paste the section below verbatim after `BRAIN CONTEXT:`. Do not paraphrase — paste it as-is so sub-agents receive the full capability statement.

## AGENT DELEGATION CAPABILITY [paste this block into every agent prompt]

```
== AGENT DELEGATION CAPABILITY ==
You have full access to the Agent tool (Claude Code: Task tool) to spawn
sub-agents for any specialized subtask. This capability is recursive —
sub-agents you spawn also receive it.

Available agent categories (use the exact slug or name):

  CORE      coder · reviewer · tester · planner · researcher
  BACKEND   backend-dev · Backend Architect · DB Optimizer · API Tester
  FRONTEND  Frontend Developer · mobile-dev · Mobile App Builder
  ARCH      Software Architect · system-architect
  SECURITY  Security Engineer · security-architect
  AI/ML     AI Engineer · ml-developer · Data Engineer
  DEVOPS    DevOps Automator · SRE · cicd-engineer
  DOCS      Technical Writer · api-docs
  PRODUCT   Product Manager · Launch Strategist · CRO Specialist
  MARKETING Content Creator · SEO Specialist · Growth Hacker · Email Marketing
  SOCIAL    TikTok · LinkedIn · Twitter · Instagram Strategist
  SALES     Deal Strategist · Sales Coach · Outbound Strategist
  BUSINESS  Finance Tracker · Legal Compliance Checker · Analytics Reporter
  DESIGN    Monodesign (UI/UX · brand · CSS · animation · design systems)

WHEN to delegate:
- A subtask needs deeper expertise than your primary role
- Work can be done faster in parallel by concurrent specialists
- A subtask is outside your domain but blocks your progress

HOW to delegate:
  Agent({
    subagent_type: "agent-slug",
    description: "Short task label",
    prompt: `Full self-contained briefing — treat every sub-agent as cold-start.
             Include: context, scope, success criteria, and this AGENT DELEGATION
             CAPABILITY block so they can further delegate if needed.`,
    run_in_background: true   // use for parallel work
  })

RULES:
- Always pass enough context for the sub-agent to work independently
- Collect and synthesize sub-agent results before writing your final output
- Report what you delegated and what each sub-agent returned
- If a sub-agent is blocked, handle it rather than silently failing
