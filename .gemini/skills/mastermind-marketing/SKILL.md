# Mastermind Marketing Domain

This skill is invoked by `mastermind:master` or directly via `/mastermind:marketing`.

---

## Inputs

- `brain_context`: BRAIN CONTEXT block (injected by master, or loaded standalone via mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md brain load)
- `prompt`: the marketing goal for this run
- `project_name`: monotask space name
- `board_id`: monotask board ID (set by master, or created standalone)
- `mode`: auto | confirm

---

## Reference Library

Before building any task briefing, identify which reference files apply and include their paths in the agent's instructions with a directive to Read them before starting work.

| Reference | When to include |
|---|---|
| `references/persuasion-psychology.md` | **Always** — all marketing tasks |
| `references/copywriting-frameworks.md` | Copy tasks: landing pages, headlines, CTAs, hero sections, any page copy; email copy: subject lines, cold outreach, nurture sequences |
| `.claude/skills/stop-slop/SKILL.md` | **All copy review** — run before delivering any written asset |
| `.claude/skills/stop-slop/references/phrases.md` | Full copy edit pass — check for banned phrases |
| `.claude/skills/stop-slop/references/structures.md` | Full copy edit pass — check structural patterns |

In each agent task briefing, add:
```
REFERENCE FILES: Read these before starting:
- .claude/skills/mastermind-marketing/references/persuasion-psychology.md
[For copy tasks (landing pages, CTAs, email copy, headlines, subject lines), also read:]
- .claude/skills/mastermind-marketing/references/copywriting-frameworks.md
[For all copy review/edit passes, also read:]
- .claude/skills/stop-slop/SKILL.md
- .claude/skills/stop-slop/references/phrases.md
- .claude/skills/stop-slop/references/structures.md
```

## Specialist Agent Routing

Use these agents instead of generic types when the task is domain-specific:

| Task | Agent slug | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Email sequences, drip campaigns, cold outreach | `email-specialist` | Any multi-email flow or cold email |
| Page CRO, signup flow, form, popup optimization | `cro-specialist` | Conversion analysis or optimization |
| Pricing decisions, tier design, pricing pages | `pricing-strategist` | Any pricing or packaging task |
| Product launch, feature announcement, GTM | `launch-strategist` | Any launch or release |
| Competitor pages, content strategy, topic planning | `competitive-content` | Competitive content or editorial planning |
| General copy and content | `content-creator` | Multi-platform content, brand storytelling |
| SEO audits, keyword strategy | `seo-specialist` | Technical SEO, organic search |
| Social media | `social-media-strategist` | Social content and calendars |
| Paid ads | `ad-creative-strategist` | Ad copy and paid creative |

For tasks outside these domains (referral programs, schema markup, analytics tracking), name the appropriate specialist agent in the briefing and let it handle depth.

---

## Complexity Assessment

Assess the prompt to determine execution mode:

**Simple (direct execution):** Single asset, single agent:
- "Write one tweet announcing the new API release"
- "Draft a subject line for the newsletter"
→ Use a single Content Creator agent. Skip manager delegation.

**Complex (spawn Marketing Manager agent):** Any of these:
- Full campaign across multiple channels
- SEO audit or keyword strategy
- Social media calendar or multi-post series
- Launch strategy requiring copy + analytics + distribution
→ Spawn Marketing Manager agent with full briefing.

---

## Standalone Execution (when called without master)

If this skill is invoked directly (not by master):

1. Load brain context following mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Load Procedure (namespace: `marketing`)
2. Run intake from mastermind-intake/SKILL.md if prompt is vague
3. Follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Monotask Space+Board Setup Procedure:
   ```bash
   project_name="${project_name:-$(basename "$PWD")}"
   space_id=$(monotask space list 2>/dev/null | awk -F' \| ' -v n="$project_name" '$2==n{print $1}' | head -1)
   [ -z "$space_id" ] && space_id=$(monotask space create "$project_name" 2>&1 | grep -oE '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}')
   [ -z "$space_id" ] && { echo "ERROR: Could not find or create space '$project_name'"; exit 1; }
   board_id=$(monotask board create "marketing" --json | jq -r '.id // empty')
   [ -z "$board_id" ] && { echo "ERROR: Failed to create marketing board"; exit 1; }
   monotask space boards add "$space_id" "$board_id" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
   todo_col=$(monotask column create "$board_id" "Todo"  --json | jq -r '.id')
   doing_col=$(monotask column create "$board_id" "Doing" --json | jq -r '.id')
   done_col=$(monotask column create "$board_id" "Done"  --json | jq -r '.id')
   ```
4. Proceed with complexity assessment below
5. At end: follow mastermind-protocol/SKILL.md Brain Write Procedure (namespace: `marketing`)

## Complex Execution — Marketing Manager Agent

Spawn a Marketing Manager agent via Task tool:

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "coordinator",
  description: `You are the Marketing Manager for project <project_name>.

CONTEXT: <date> | Project: <project_name> | Spawned by: mastermind:marketing

BRAIN CONTEXT:
<brain_context>

YOUR BOARD: <board_id>
YOUR GOAL: <prompt>

STEP 1 — PLAN
Decompose the marketing goal into parallel workstreams. For each workstream, identify:
- Which channel or medium it targets (social, SEO, email, paid, content)
- Which specialist to assign
- What deliverables are needed (copy, strategy doc, keyword list, calendar)
- Dependencies between workstreams

STEP 2 — CREATE TASKS
For each workstream, create a monotask card on the project board.
First look up column IDs and assign shell variables:
```bash
columns=$(monotask column list "$BOARD_ID" --json)
COL_TODO_ID=$(echo "$columns" | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Todo" or .title == "Backlog") | .id' | head -1)
COL_DONE_ID=$(echo "$columns" | jq -r '.[] | select(.title == "Done") | .id' | head -1)
```
Then create the card:
```bash
result=$(monotask card create "$BOARD_ID" "$COL_TODO_ID" "<short summary of workstream goal, ≤80 chars>" --json)
CARD_ID=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.id // empty')
monotask card set-description "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "[specific marketing workstream goal]"
monotask card comment add "$BOARD_ID" "$CARD_ID" "CONTEXT: <date> | Project: <project_name> | Created by: Marketing Manager
BRAIN MEMORY: [paste most relevant 3-5 brain context excerpts]
SCOPE: [channel, audience, tone, brand constraints]
CONSTRAINTS: [brand voice, legal/compliance, budget limits, existing assets]
REFERENCE FILES: [for copy/content workstreams: .claude/skills/mastermind-marketing/references/persuasion-psychology.md; for copy tasks also: .claude/skills/mastermind-marketing/references/copywriting-frameworks.md; for copy review/edit: .claude/skills/stop-slop/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/stop-slop/references/phrases.md, .claude/skills/stop-slop/references/structures.md]
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] [checkable item]
AGENT: [Content Creator | Email Marketing Specialist | CRO Specialist | Pricing Strategist | Launch Strategist | Competitive Content Strategist | SEO Specialist | Social Media Strategist | Analytics Reporter | Ad Creative Strategist]
SWARM: star 5 parallel
DEPENDENCIES: [task IDs or \"none\"]
OUTPUT FORMAT: unified output schema"
```

STEP 3 — EXECUTE
Spawn one Task agent per workstream (all in parallel — star topology, hub aggregates):
- Copy and content: subagent_type "Content Creator"
- SEO: subagent_type "SEO Specialist"
- Social media: subagent_type "Social Media Strategist"
- Analytics and measurement: subagent_type "Analytics Reporter"
- Ad creative: subagent_type "Ad Creative Strategist"
- Email sequences / drip campaigns: subagent_type "Email Marketing Specialist" (slug: email-specialist)
- Page / flow CRO: subagent_type "CRO Specialist" (slug: cro-specialist)
- Pricing strategy / packaging: subagent_type "Pricing Strategist" (slug: pricing-strategist)
- Product launch / GTM: subagent_type "Launch Strategist" (slug: launch-strategist)
- Competitive content / comparison pages: subagent_type "Competitive Content Strategist" (slug: competitive-content)

Also run /mastermind:do --board <board_id> to track execution.

STEP 4 — COLLECT AND RETURN
Collect all agent outputs. Return to caller:

domain: marketing
status: complete | partial | blocked
artifacts:
  - path: [each asset created — copy doc, keyword list, social calendar]
    type: copy
decisions:
  - what: [channel prioritization or messaging decisions]
    why: [reasoning]
    confidence: [0.0-1.0]
    outcome: pending | shipped
lessons:
  - what_worked: [which channels or approaches were strongest]
  - what_didnt: [what needed more brand context or iteration]
next_actions:
  - [e.g. "run mastermind:content to produce the blog series"]
  - [e.g. "run mastermind:review on the campaign copy"]
board_url: monotask://<project_name>/marketing
run_id: <ISO8601-timestamp>`,
  run_in_background: true
})
```

---

## Simple Execution

For simple tasks (single agent, single asset):

1. Spawn one Task agent with the marketing request as a self-contained briefing
2. Collect output
3. Return unified output schema with `status: complete`
